<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](demo_ss.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

For this project we were tasked with building an Image Uploader application, with the ability to

- Drag and Drop Images or Upload them through a button
- Allow users to view image and provide a link to the uploaded image

Overall it was a challenging, but enjoyable experience. Before coming accross dev challenges, I would always start projects but never complete them or even get to deploying them. By completing this challenge, not only have I learned how to create and navigate a full-stack application, but also how to deploy one. Whether you are a beginner or experienced developer, this will be great for you to take on.
